# Exploratory Data Analysis on Flight Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a flight dataset. The aim of this analysis is to uncover insights into flight trends, delays, and other relevant metrics to understand the overall performance and factors affecting flights.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes information on various flights such as:

Flight ID
Airline
Origin and Destination Airports
Scheduled Departure and Arrival Times
Actual Departure and Arrival Times
Delay Times
Distance
Other relevant flight details

## Objectives
The main objectives of this EDA are to:

Understand the overall structure and content of the flight dataset.
Analyze flight trends over time.
Identify factors contributing to flight delays.
Visualize key insights and trends.

## Files
Clean_Dataset.csv: The dataset containing flight information.
main.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the exploratory data analysis. It is the combined version of the other three files.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## How to Use

### Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/AayushBade14/Raid-Activity---Exploratory_Data_Analysis_On_Flight_Dataset

### Navigate to the repository directory:
cd Raid-Activity---Exploratory_Data_Analysis_On_Flight_Dataset

### Open the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
Run the notebook cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter

You can install the required packages using:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter

## Conclusion
This exploratory data analysis provides valuable insights into the flight dataset, highlighting trends, delays, and key factors affecting flight performance. Further analysis and modeling can be conducted to predict delays and optimize flight schedules.
